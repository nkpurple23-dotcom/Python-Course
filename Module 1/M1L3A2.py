# 1) Create variables to store different types of values:
# - `name` as text (string)
name="Nikitha"
# - `age` as a whole number (integer)
age=12
# - `is_student` as True/False (boolean)
is_student=True
# - `weight` as a decimal number (float)
weight=90.5
# 2) Print each variable’s value.
print(name, age, is_student, weight)
# 3) Print the datatype of each variable using `type()`.
print(type(name))
print(type(weight))
print(type(age))
print(type(is_student))
# 4) Show a message that type casting will happen next.
print("Type casting will happen.")
# 5) Convert `age` from an integer to a string and store it back in `age`.
str(age)
# 6) Print `age` and print its datatype again to confirm it changed.
print(age, type(age))
# 7) Convert `weight` from a float to an integer and store it back in `weight`.
int(weight)
# 8) Print `weight` and print its datatype again to confirm it changed.
print(weight, type(weight))
